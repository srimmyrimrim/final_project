      1.In a sentence, explain the behavior you expected.
     2.In a sentence, explain the observed behavior
      3.Formulate a hypothesis about what might be causing the mismatch: what part of your code or what part of your circuit is behaving in a way you don't expect?
      4.Test your hypothesis: what action can you take you determine if your hypothesis is true?
      5.What is the result of your test?
  


    1.
      1. when i type, the character is printed in (20,20).
      2. when i type, nothing happens
      3. i need a line that reads the key i am pressing and convert it into a character.
      4. if i can get one letter to print on(20,20)
      5. nothing
      
    2.
      1. when i type, a character should be printed
      2. when i tpe, nothing happens.
      3. i need to find out how to get the read key to print. I thinkif i use the char function it will work
      4. get one letter to pritn on (20,20);
      5.print.... finally
  
    3.
      1. when i type, the character is printed in a straight line.
      2. when i type, all the cahracters are printed at (20,20).
      3. i need to make an x and y varible that increases at a certain rate.
      4. if it prints out a whole line.
      5. printed

    4.
      1. when i type, the characters should have space between so they dont overlap.
      2. when i type, the characters overlap a little.
      3. i need to create a width for each letter so they have a little white border around
      4. as long as they dont overlap
      5. printed. however there are some that have too much space and some still overlap.

    5.
      1. i want the backspace to go back and delete the last character.
      2. instead it prints an white box forward.
      3. i need to create a a if loop so that if it read that the backspace key, it will subtract the negative amount of the letter width and print the box on top of the previous letter.
      4. a white box to layer itself ontop of the previous character
      5.printed, however, it prints underneath the character.
    
    6.
      1. i want the backspace to go back and delete the last character.
      2. the white box is printed backwards, but it does not cover the letter, instead it prints underneath it.
      3. i need to set the height of the box so it covers all of the letter 
      4.a white box to lay ontop of the previous character
      5. a white box that prints ontop of half of the character.
      
    7.
      1. i want the backspace to go back and competley cover the last character
      2. the white box prints backwards in teh right diretion, but it does not cover the whole letter
      3.and more height and  little more width to the box so it covers all of the letter
      4.a white box that covers the whole previous character
      5.printed
    
  8.
      1. i want the each letter to have its own color and blend into the backgorund so you can see what you are typing.
      2. the color of the letter does not change.
      3. i probably have to added it into void key pressed where the letters are typed
      4. every letter has a different color
      5. they colors are too consistent and not different enough
      
    9. 
      1. i want each letter to have its own color
      2 the color is not varied enough
      3 make the HSB rang to 26 since there are only 26 letters in the alphabet
      4 every letter a different color
      5 printed
      
    10.
      1. now i want the period to be black
      2. it does not print as it is not assigned.
      3. create an if statement for period like i did for the backspace
      4. a black period prints
      5. nothing happens
      
    11. 
      1. i want to use the string method (change the code entirely) 
      2. right now the letters do not align perfectly leaving odd gaps.
      3. find how to print while typing, probably use the similar method with key and its start and finish vairables
      4.prints out the typed string
      5.printed
      
    12. 
      1. need to create a new kind of backspace
      2. the older one doesn't apply or work for string method
      3. i probably will have to delet the lentgh of the string by one, so that its missing its last character while making the string lentgh shorter.
      4. deletes the previous letter
      5. crashes after i delete where there are no more letters
      
    13. 
      1. backspace is needed
      2. doesnt work, crashed
      3. proabaly have to make sure its is greater than one so it doesnt try to go negative and crash java
      4. stops deleting after the very last letter is deleted
      5. printed.
      
    14.
      1. add color to the letters
      2. the old method wond work for the string 
      3. create a varible for hue
      4. gives every letter a color
      5.printed
      
    15.
      1. wants to give the background the same color as the letters
      2. at the moment it is white
      3. add the same hue as the letter
      4. a full color screen
      5. printed
      
    16.
      1. give period block fill with white background
      2. stays the same color as the previous letter
      3. create a new varible for brightness and saturation for both the background and character for each letter
      4. a solid color screen that turns white after you press period and turns all the words black.
      5. prints only wite background
      
    17.
      1. give other puncutuation black on white
      2. prints invisible with other colors
      3. jsut add them iin with the period as or (||)
      4.a solid color screen that turns whte after you press ? . ! ; , with black fill
      5.printed
    
    18.
      1. give sound to the typing
      2. its kind of boring
      3. use the sound libray that comes with processing
      4. make noise after pressing keys
      5. nothing but errors
      
    19.
      1. give sound to the typing
      2. gave me to many errors
      3. use a different sound library, minim
      4. make noise after pressing keys
      5. meow
