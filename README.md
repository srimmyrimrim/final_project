#final_project_proposal


##Summary: 
My project will be a imatating Microsoft Word with a twist. I want to make a typerwirter like program that messes with the user as much as possible. The input would be the keyboard, and the output would be a processing sketch. Every letter key on the keyboard types the letter it corresponds to and at the same time triggers an event that creates an obstacle or annoyance to the user until he or she is finished writing a sentence and ends with a period. After the period is pushed, the entire program would go back to the default look of a regular Word document and repeat new triggers until the period is pressed. 

##Component Parts:
All of the project would be done with processing or any other progamming application that will be able to produce the sketch.

##Challenges: 
Most of my time will be spent on compiling each key with its own event, and the most difficult part making sure that the text lines up with each other like it does in Microsoft Word. 

##Project Timeline:
  Week 1:
   -will be spending most of my time planning which key is going to play what animation/event/obstacle.
   -figuring out how to imatate word and a typewriter on processing.
   -finding out if it is possible to printing and erase letters.
 Week 2:
    -start the programming the base of the sketch
 Week 3:
    -finish up the base
    -start putting code for each character
    -trial and error begins..
Week 4:
    -continue coding for characters
Week 5:
    -finish up coding for characters
    -fine tuning
